When ufo dies 10% chance to burst into flames and spin off in random direction and destroy rocks/ufos 
200% scale thrust.gif appears behind ufo
ufo emits 20-42 firey electric sparks per second, 1-20 per burst until dead, random velocities, random directions, random small sizes  
ufo quickly accelerates in a random direction or spirals outward at 250 units/second with 50px minimum radius, up to full speed and 10x rotation
ufo wont take damage but will collide with things for 3 in game time effected seconds
ufo explodes on contact with an asteroid, asteroid registers hit as normal 
ufo explodes on contact with another ufo, that ufo registers a hit like normal
ufo explodes on contact with player and player registers a hit like normal
Ufo collisions have 50% chance of spin out 
UFO player shot death have 10% chance to spin out 
UFO shots have a 33% chance to break asteroid 
ALL UFOs on level 1 have 100% chance to spin out on death 


UFO "Burst into Flames" Death Effect - Implementation Questions

**1. Visual Effects:**
- Do you want me to use the existing `fire.gif` image for the thrust effect, or should I create a new flame effect?
use the new spinout.gif, drawn underneath the ufo, cenetered on the ufo 

- For the "20-42 firey electric sparks per second" - should these be similar to the existing particle system, or do you want a specific visual style?
similar to the exisiting system. 

- Should the UFO maintain its original image during the flame burst, or should it change appearance?
original immage 

**2. Physics & Movement:**
- When you say "spirals outward" - do you want a spiral pattern, or just random acceleration in different directions?
when triggered, ufo has a 50% chance to go straight in a random direction and 50% chance to move in a spiral pattern outward from its current position 

- What should be the maximum speed multiplier for the "up to full speed" acceleration?
when triggered, ufo will quickly accelerate to 2x speed 

- Should the rotation speed increase gradually or instantly to "10x rotation"?
rotation speed should increase gradually to (random value between 1x and 10x) but this will not influence ufo movement 

**3. Collision Behavior:**
- When the flaming UFO collides with asteroids/other UFOs/player, should it explode immediately or continue for a brief moment?
explode .5 game seconds afterwards 

- Should the collision damage be the same as a normal UFO hit, or different?
same

- Do you want any special visual effects when the flaming UFO collides with something?
normal particle effects as appropriate for ufo behavior 

**4. Timing & Duration:**
- The "3 in game seconds" duration - should this be fixed or random?
3 game time effected seconds (fixed duration) 

- Should the flame effect start immediately when the UFO dies, or after a brief delay?
scale size up from 0% to 100% in 1 in game time effected second 

**5. Integration:**
- I see there's already a particle system and explosion handling. Should I integrate with the existing `Particle` class and `ExplosionManager`?
whatever is best and optimal without disturbing anything else

- Should this effect work with both regular UFOs and the `AdvancedUFO` class?
yes 

**6. Performance:**
- With 20-42 sparks per second, should there be any performance limits or optimizations?
nope

- Should the effect be limited to a certain number of UFOs at once?
nope 

**7. Additional Details:**
- Should the 10% chance to burst into flames be configurable or hardcoded?
hardcoded 

- Do you want any sound effects for the flame burst?
not yet 

- Should the flaming UFO be immune to further damage from projectiles during the effect?
yes 

- Any specific color scheme for the sparks (red/orange/yellow flames, or electric blue/white)?
66% firey 34% electric 




Spinout Duration: You mentioned "0.5-1.5 game time effected seconds" - should this be a random duration within that range, or should it be a fixed duration?
random within range

Spiral Pattern: For the 50% chance spiral movement, do you want a classic logarithmic spiral (like a galaxy arm) or a simple circular spiral that expands outward?
logarithmic

Speed Multiplier: When you say "quickly accelerate to 2x speed" - should this be 2x the UFO's current speed, or 2x its base/maximum speed?
2x base/maximum

Particle Integration: I see the existing particle system has different explosion types. Should the spinout sparks use the existing add_explosion method with fire/electric colors, or do you want a separate particle system specifically for the spinout effect?
yes

Visual Scaling: For the spinout.gif scaling from 0% to 100% over 1 second - should this be a smooth linear scale, or do you want any easing (like ease-in/out)?
smooth

Collision Immunity: When the UFO is in spinout mode and immune to projectiles, should the bullets pass through it visually, or should they still create hit particles but not damage the UFO?
create hit particles for all collisions as appropriate
