# ✅ ChuckSTARoids v5 - Score Submit Fixes Complete!

## 🎮 Issues Fixed

### ✅ **Double Text Issue Resolved**
- **Problem:** The score submit screen was showing duplicate instruction text at the bottom
- **Cause:** Both the `draw_name_input()` function and the main draw loop were rendering instruction text
- **Solution:** Removed the duplicate text rendering from the main draw loop when name input is active

### ✅ **Controls Properly Limited**
- **Verified:** Only ENTER and ESC controls work during score submission
- **Current Controls in Score Submit:**
  - **ENTER:** Submit the score
  - **ESC:** Cancel/close score submission
  - **BACKSPACE:** Delete characters (normal typing behavior)
  - **Printable characters:** Type name (normal typing behavior)
- **All other keys are properly ignored** during score submission

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Was Changed:
1. **Removed duplicate instruction text** from the main game draw loop when `name_input_active` is True
2. **Verified key handling** - the existing code already properly restricts controls during name input
3. **Maintained clean UI** - only the dialog box instructions are shown

### Key Handling Structure:
```python
if self.name_input_active:
    # Handle only specific keys: ENTER, ESC, BACKSPACE, printable chars
    # Use 'continue' to skip all other key processing
    continue
```
