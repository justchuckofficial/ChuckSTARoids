# Chucksteroids v4 - Standalone Executable Packaging

This guide explains how to package `chuckstaroidsv4.py` as a standalone executable that can run on any Windows computer without requiring Python or any dependencies.

## Quick Start

1. **Double-click `build_chuckstaroidsv4.bat`** - This will automatically build the executable
2. **Run the generated `Chucksteroids_v4_Standalone.exe`** - The game will work exactly as it does in Python

## What Gets Packaged

The executable includes:
- ✅ All Python dependencies (pygame, numpy, etc.)
- ✅ All game graphics (.gif files)
- ✅ All configuration files (.txt, .md files)
- ✅ The game icon (xwing.ico)
- ✅ Complete game functionality

## File Structure

```
chuckstaroidsv4.py              # Main game file
chuckstaroidsv4.spec            # PyInstaller configuration
build_chuckstaroidsv4.bat       # Build script
requirements.txt                # Python dependencies
*.gif                           # All game graphics
xwing.ico                       # Game icon
```

## Build Process

The build script (`build_chuckstaroidsv4.bat`) does the following:

1. **Cleans** previous builds
2. **Installs** required packages (pygame, numpy, pyinstaller)
3. **Builds** the executable using PyInstaller
4. **Tests** the executable automatically
5. **Creates** a convenient copy with a clear name

## Generated Files

After building, you'll get:
- `dist/Chucksteroids_v4.exe` - The main executable
- `Chucksteroids_v4_Standalone.exe` - Convenient copy in main directory

## Features of the Standalone Executable

### ✅ **Fully Portable**
- Can be renamed to anything you want
- Can be moved to any folder and still works
- No installation required

### ✅ **Self-Contained**
- Contains all dependencies embedded
- Works on computers without Python installed
- Works on computers without pygame or numpy

### ✅ **Complete Graphics**
- All game sprites and animations included
- Proper image loading and rotation
- Full visual experience maintained

### ✅ **Cross-Computer Compatible**
- Works on any Windows 10/11 computer
- No additional software installation needed
- Maintains full game functionality

## Manual Build Process

If you prefer to build manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller

# Build using spec file
pyinstaller chuckstaroidsv4.spec

# Or build with command line (alternative method)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name="Chucksteroids_v4" --icon="xwing.ico" --add-data="*.gif;." --add-data="*.jpg;." --add-data="*.ico;." --add-data="*.txt;." --add-data="*.md;." chuckstaroidsv4.py
```

## Testing the Executable

To verify everything works:

1. **Run the executable** - Game should start normally
2. **Test graphics** - All sprites and animations should display
3. **Test gameplay** - All game mechanics should work
4. **Move the file** - Copy to another folder and test again
5. **Rename the file** - Rename and test that it still works

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Ensure all `.gif` files are present in the directory
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
- Make sure PyInstaller is installed: `pip install pyinstaller`

### Executable Doesn't Start
- Check that all image files are included in the build
- Verify the `get_resource_path` function is working correctly
- Look for error messages in the console (if any)

### Graphics Missing
- Ensure all `.gif` files are in the same directory as the Python file
- Check that the spec file includes all necessary data files
- Verify image loading paths in the code

## File Sizes

Expected executable size: ~50-100 MB (includes all dependencies and assets)

This is normal for a standalone Python game with graphics and dependencies.

## Distribution

The `Chucksteroids_v4_Standalone.exe` file can be:
- ✅ Shared with anyone via email, USB drive, etc.
- ✅ Uploaded to file sharing services
- ✅ Run on any Windows computer without setup
- ✅ Renamed and moved without breaking

## Technical Details

### PyInstaller Configuration
The `chuckstaroidsv4.spec` file configures:
- **One-file packaging** - Everything in a single executable
- **Windowed mode** - No console window appears
- **Data inclusion** - All graphics and config files embedded
- **Hidden imports** - All necessary Python modules included
- **Icon** - Game icon embedded in executable

### Resource Loading
The game uses `get_resource_path()` function that:
- Works in development (loads from current directory)
- Works in PyInstaller (loads from embedded resources)
- Handles both scenarios automatically

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all `.gif` files are present
2. Verify Python dependencies are installed
3. Ensure PyInstaller is working correctly
4. Test the original Python file first

The standalone executable should provide the exact same experience as running the Python file directly.
