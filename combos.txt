COMBO & SCORING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS
================================================

Based on the requirements in fixes.txt:
- Add combo system, the score bright white duration multiples the score 1x at 0 seconds - 3x at 3 seconds
- Also increase score multiplier by .01x per asteroid broken in that level resetting on new game new level or death
- show score multiplier after the score in white to green, white 0% and full green 5x

CURRENT GAME ANALYSIS:
=====================
- Current scoring system exists with add_score() method
- Score pulse effect already implemented (bright white duration)
- Asteroids destroyed via: player shots, shield collisions, ability blasts, UFO collisions
- Level progression when len(self.asteroids) == 0
- Score milestones: 100k (shields), 250k (shields+abilities), 500k (extra life)

IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS:
========================

1. COMBO TIMER DURATION & BEHAVIOR:
   - Should combo multiplier be linear progression (1x → 2x → 3x over 3 seconds)?
   - Does it cap at 3x after 3 seconds, or continue increasing?
   - What happens at 4+ seconds - reset to 1x or stay at 3x?
   - Should the timer reset immediately when an asteroid is destroyed?

2. SCORE MULTIPLIER INTEGRATION:
   - Combo multiplier: 1x-3x based on time since last destruction
   - Level multiplier: +0.01x per asteroid destroyed in current level
   - Should these multiply together? (combo × level = final multiplier)
   - Or should they be additive? (combo + level = final multiplier)
   - Example: combo=2x, level=1.5x → final=3x (multiply) or 3.5x (add)?

3. VISUAL DISPLAY SPECIFICATIONS:
   - Which multiplier should show the "white to green" display?
     * Combo multiplier (1x-3x range)?
     * Level multiplier (0x-5x range)?
     * Combined final multiplier?
   - Where should it appear on screen?
     * Next to the score?
     * Below the score?
     * Separate HUD element?
   - Color gradient: white (0%) to green (5x) - what does 0% represent?
     * 0% = 1x multiplier (no bonus)?
     * 0% = 0x multiplier (no bonus)?

4. RESET CONDITIONS:
   - Combo timer should reset on: new game, new level, death?
   - Level multiplier should reset on: new game, new level, death?
   - Or should level multiplier persist across levels but reset on death/new game?
   - Should both systems reset on the same conditions?

5. ASTEROID DESTRUCTION TRIGGERS:
   - Should combo system trigger on ALL asteroid destructions?
   - Or only specific types:
     * Player shots only?
     * Direct player actions (shots, shields, abilities)?
     * Exclude UFO vs asteroid collisions?
   - Current destruction methods in game:
     * Player shot hits asteroid
     * Player shield collides with asteroid
     * Player ability blast hits asteroid
     * UFO collides with asteroid

6. MAXIMUM MULTIPLIER CAPS:
   - "Full green 5x" refers to:
     * Combo system maximum (3x)?
     * Level multiplier maximum (5x)?
     * Combined system maximum?
   - Should there be caps on either system?
   - Level multiplier: +0.01x per asteroid - what's the maximum per level?

7. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   - Should combo timer be independent of game time dilation?
   - Should level multiplier persist during ability breaking sequences?
   - How should the system handle the existing score pulse effect?
   - Should combo multiplier affect the score pulse duration/intensity?

8. UI/UX CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Should there be visual feedback when combo multiplier changes?
   - Should there be sound effects for different multiplier levels?
   - Should the multiplier display pulse or animate?
   - Should there be a combo counter (e.g., "x5 COMBO")?

9. INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS:
   - How should this interact with existing score milestones (100k, 250k, 500k)?
   - Should combo/level multipliers affect milestone calculations?
   - Should the system work with the existing score pulse effect?

10. EDGE CASES:
    - What happens if player destroys multiple asteroids simultaneously?
    - Should rapid successive destructions extend the combo timer?
    - How should the system handle asteroid splitting (creates multiple asteroids)?
    - Should destroyed asteroids from splitting count toward level multiplier?

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
===================
Once questions are answered, the implementation will involve:

1. Add combo system variables to Game class:
   - combo_timer: tracks time since last asteroid destruction
   - combo_multiplier: current combo multiplier (1x-3x)
   - level_multiplier: current level multiplier (starts at 1.0x)
   - asteroids_destroyed_this_level: counter for level multiplier

2. Modify add_score() method to apply multipliers

3. Add combo timer update logic in main game loop

4. Add visual display for multiplier(s)

5. Add reset logic for new game/level/death

6. Integrate with existing asteroid destruction detection

7. Test with all asteroid destruction methods

CURRENT CODE LOCATIONS TO MODIFY:
=================================
- Game.__init__(): Add combo system variables
- Game.add_score(): Apply multiplier logic
- Game.update(): Update combo timer
- Game.draw_score_with_pulse(): Add multiplier display
- Asteroid destruction handlers: Trigger combo system
- Game.start_new_game(): Reset combo system
- Game.start_new_level(): Reset combo system (if needed)
- Game.handle_ship_death(): Reset combo system (if needed)
