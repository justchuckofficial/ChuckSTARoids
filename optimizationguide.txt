=====================================
PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
=====================================

1. OBJECT POOLING FOR PARTICLES
   Current Issue: The ExplosionSystem creates new Particle objects every time an explosion occurs, causing frequent memory allocations and garbage collection pauses.
   Solution: Implement a ParticlePool class that pre-allocates a fixed number of Particle objects and reuses them. When a particle dies, return it to the pool instead of deleting it.
   Impact: Reduces memory allocation by 80-90%, eliminates GC stutters, improves frame rate consistency.
   Implementation: Create a pool of 500-1000 pre-allocated particles, add reset() method to Particle class, modify ExplosionSystem to use pool.get_particle() and pool.return_particle().

2. SPATIAL PARTITIONING FOR COLLISION DETECTION
   Current Issue: The game uses O(n²) collision detection, checking every bullet against every asteroid, every asteroid against every other asteroid, etc.
   Solution: Implement a spatial grid system that divides the screen into cells. Only check collisions between objects in the same or adjacent cells.
   Impact: Reduces collision checks from O(n²) to O(n), massive performance improvement with many objects.
   Implementation: Create a SpatialGrid class with 100x100 pixel cells, update object positions in grid each frame, only check collisions within 3x3 cell neighborhoods.

3. MATH CACHING FOR TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
   Current Issue: The game calls math.cos() and math.sin() thousands of times per frame for ship rotation, bullet trajectories, and UFO AI calculations.
   Solution: Pre-calculate and cache trigonometric values for common angles (every 5 degrees), use lookup tables instead of real-time calculations.
   Impact: 10-15x faster trigonometric calculations, smoother gameplay on slower systems.
   Implementation: Create MathCache class with dictionaries for cos/sin values, round angles to nearest 5 degrees for cache lookup.

4. IMAGE TRANSFORMATION CACHING
   Current Issue: The Ship class calls pygame.transform.rotate() every frame to draw the ship at different angles, which is expensive.
   Solution: Pre-cache rotated ship images for common angles (every 5-10 degrees) and store them in a dictionary.
   Impact: Eliminates expensive rotation calculations during gameplay, 3-5x faster ship rendering.
   Implementation: Generate rotated images in Ship.__init__(), store in self.rotated_images dict, use cached image in draw() method.

5. DIRTY FLAGGING FOR RENDERING
   Current Issue: The game redraws the entire screen every frame, even when nothing has changed.
   Solution: Implement a dirty flag system that only redraws areas of the screen that have actually changed.
   Impact: 2-3x faster rendering when few objects are moving, better performance on integrated graphics.
   Implementation: Track which screen regions need redrawing, use pygame.Rect for dirty areas, only blit changed regions.

6. LIST COMPREHENSION OPTIMIZATION
   Current Issue: The game uses traditional for loops with append() operations for filtering active objects.
   Solution: Use list comprehensions and built-in filter functions for cleaner, faster code.
   Impact: 20-30% faster object filtering, cleaner code, better Python optimization.
   Implementation: Replace "for obj in objects: if obj.active: active_objects.append(obj)" with "[obj for obj in objects if obj.active]".

7. VECTOR OPERATIONS WITH NUMPY
   Current Issue: Custom Vector2D class uses pure Python math operations for all vector calculations.
   Solution: Replace Vector2D with numpy arrays for vector operations, which are optimized in C.
   Impact: 5-10x faster vector math, especially for bulk operations like particle updates.
   Implementation: Use numpy.array for position/velocity, leverage numpy's vectorized operations for magnitude, normalization, rotation.

8. BULLET POOLING
   Current Issue: Bullets are created and destroyed frequently, causing memory allocation overhead.
   Solution: Implement a bullet pool similar to particle pooling, reuse bullet objects.
   Impact: Reduces memory fragmentation, eliminates bullet creation/destruction overhead.
   Implementation: Pre-allocate 100-200 bullet objects, reset and reuse when needed.

9. SOUND CACHING AND COMPRESSION
   Current Issue: Music generation creates new sound objects every time, and sounds are not compressed.
   Solution: Cache generated sounds, use compressed audio formats, implement sound pooling.
   Impact: Reduces memory usage by 60-70%, faster sound loading, better audio performance.
   Implementation: Cache generated tones, use OGG compression, implement sound effect pooling.

10. COLLISION DETECTION OPTIMIZATION
    Current Issue: The game checks every possible collision combination, including many unnecessary checks.
    Solution: Use early exit strategies, distance-based culling, and collision layers.
    Impact: 40-50% fewer collision checks, better performance with many objects.
    Implementation: Check distance before expensive collision math, use collision layers (bullets vs asteroids, etc.).

=====================================
CODE STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
=====================================

11. CONFIGURATION CLASS
    Current Issue: Game constants are scattered throughout the code (magic numbers, hardcoded values).
    Solution: Create a GameConfig class that centralizes all configuration values.
    Impact: Easier tuning, better maintainability, cleaner code, easier to create difficulty levels.
    Implementation: Move all constants to GameConfig class, use config values throughout code.

12. STATE MACHINE REFACTORING
    Current Issue: Game state management is handled with simple string comparisons and scattered logic.
    Solution: Implement a proper state machine with dedicated state classes and clear transitions.
    Impact: Cleaner code, easier to add new states, better debugging, more maintainable.
    Implementation: Create GameState base class, implement WaitingState, PlayingState, GameOverState, PausedState.

13. EVENT SYSTEM
    Current Issue: Game objects are tightly coupled, making it hard to add new features or modify existing ones.
    Solution: Implement an event system where objects can subscribe to and emit events.
    Impact: Loose coupling, easier to add features, better testability, cleaner architecture.
    Implementation: Create EventManager class, define game events (ship_destroyed, level_complete, etc.), use observer pattern.

14. COMPONENT-BASED ARCHITECTURE
    Current Issue: Game objects have monolithic classes with mixed responsibilities.
    Solution: Break down objects into components (Position, Velocity, Renderer, Collider, etc.).
    Impact: More flexible, easier to add new features, better code reuse, cleaner separation of concerns.
    Implementation: Create Component base class, implement specific components, use composition over inheritance.

15. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    Current Issue: Images and sounds are loaded multiple times, no centralized resource management.
    Solution: Create a ResourceManager class that handles all asset loading, caching, and cleanup.
    Impact: Reduced memory usage, faster loading, better error handling, centralized resource management.
    Implementation: Implement ResourceManager with image/sound caches, lazy loading, memory management.

    Impact: Better player retention, more engaging gameplay, balanced challenge.
    Implementation: Track player metrics (accuracy, survival time, score rate), adjust UFO spawn rates, asteroid speeds, bullet speeds.

17. PREDICTIVE AI IMPROVEMENTS
    Current Issue: UFO AI is reactive and predictable, making gameplay less challenging.
    Solution: Implement more sophisticated AI with pattern recognition, player behavior prediction, and adaptive strategies.

    Implementation: Add profiling decorators, performance metrics, frame rate monitoring, memory usage tracking.

25. MODULARIZATION AND PACKAGING
    Current Issue: All code is in a single large file, making it hard to maintain and extend.
    Solution: Break the code into logical modules and packages.
    Impact: Better organization, easier maintenance, better code reuse, cleaner architecture.
    Implementation: Create separate modules for graphics, audio, physics, AI, game states, utilities.
