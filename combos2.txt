COMBO MULTIPLIER SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS
==================================================

Based on your requirements, I need clarification on several details before implementing:

1. COMBO TIMER BEHAVIOR:
   - You mentioned "1x at 0 seconds - 3x at 3 seconds, 5x at 5 seconds and linear inbetween"
   - Does this mean: 0s=1x, 1s=2x, 2s=3x, 3s=3x, 4s=4x, 5s=5x?
yes
   - What happens after 5 seconds - does it cap at 5x or continue increasing?
continues increasing 

2. COMBO TIMER RESET:
   - When exactly should the combo timer reset?
   linked with the bright white duration timer for the score 

3. LEVEL MULTIPLIER:
   - "+0.01x per asteroid broken in that level" - so 100 asteroids = +1.0x = 2x total?
   100 asteroids = 1x 

   also +.1x per ufo killed by player 

   - Does this mean level multiplier starts at 1.0x and goes up to potentially 5x+?
   yes

   - Should there be a cap on level multiplier?
no

4. COMBINED MULTIPLIERS:
   - How should combo multiplier and level multiplier combine?
Add together: (combo + level - 1) = final multiplier? Example: combo=3x, level=2x → final= 4x (add)

5. VISUAL DISPLAY:
   - "white to green, white 1x and full green 5x" - which multiplier should show this?
   - The combo multiplier (1x-5x range) 
   Where on screen should it appear? 
   next to score to the right "100000 x5"

6. DISPLAY CONDITIONS:
   - "if score multiplier is 1x or less, don't print it" - does this mean:
Don't show anything when multiplier ≤ 1.0x?
Show when multiplier > 1.0x?

7. ASTEROID DESTRUCTION TRIGGERS:
   - Should the combo system trigger on ALL asteroid destructions?
just those destroyed by the player shots or player collisions or ability blasts 

8. RESET CONDITIONS:
   - Combo timer resets on: new game, new level, death?
combo timer resets linked to the score bright white duration timer, when duration timer is 0 muiltiplier is 1x when duration timer is 5, multiplier is 5x  

   - Level multiplier resets on: new game, new level, death?
new game, death

9. SCORE PULSE INTEGRATION:
   - Should the existing "score bright white duration" be the combo timer?
   yes
   - Should the combo multiplier affect the score pulse intensity/duration?
no

10. MAXIMUM VALUES:
    - What should be the maximum combo multiplier? (5x as mentioned?)
no cap 
    - What should be the maximum level multiplier? (unlimited or capped?)
unlimited 
    - What should be the maximum combined multiplier?
unliimited 

11. UI/UX CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Should there be visual feedback when combo multiplier changes?
no
    - Should there be sound effects for different multiplier levels?
no
    - Should the multiplier display pulse or animate?
pulse when increasing 

    - Should there be a combo counter (e.g., "x5 COMBO")?
no 


12. INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS:
    - How should this interact with existing score milestones (100k, 250k, 500k)?
no change 

    - Should combo/level multipliers affect milestone calculations?
yes 
    - Should the system work with the existing score pulse effect?
yes 

13. EDGE CASES:
    - What happens if player destroys multiple asteroids simultaneously?
use exisiting logic 

    - Should rapid successive destructions extend the combo timer?
use existing logic 

    - How should the system handle asteroid splitting (creates multiple asteroids)?
one trigger per asteroid hit 

    - Should destroyed asteroids from splitting count toward level multiplier?
no 


14. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
    - Should combo timer be independent of game time dilation?
yes 
    - Should level multiplier persist during ability breaking sequences?
yes     
    - How should the system handle the existing score pulse effect?
    no change 

    - Should combo multiplier affect the score pulse duration/intensity?
no
