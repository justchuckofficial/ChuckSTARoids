# Chucksteroids Packaging Summary

## What Was Accomplished
Successfully packaged the Chucksteroids game into a single, standalone executable file that can be renamed, moved, and run anywhere without requiring Python or additional dependencies.

## Files Created
1. **Chucksteroids_Standalone.exe** - Main executable (33MB)
2. **chucksteroids.spec** - PyInstaller specification file
3. **build_exe.bat** - Simple build script
4. **build_standalone.bat** - Comprehensive build script
5. **test_executable.bat** - Test script for the executable
6. **EXECUTABLE_README.md** - User documentation
7. **PACKAGING_SUMMARY.md** - This summary

## Key Features of the Packaged Executable
- **Self-Contained**: All Python runtime, libraries, and game assets embedded
- **Portable**: Can be renamed and moved to any location
- **No Dependencies**: Runs on any Windows 10+ system without Python
- **All Assets Included**: All images, sounds, and data files embedded
- **Optimized Size**: 33MB total (reasonable for a full game with assets)

```

## Verification
- Executable builds successfully without errors
- All required assets are included
- Executable can be renamed and moved
- No external dependencies required
- Windows 64-bit compatible

## Usage Instructions

2. The executable can be renamed to anything you want
3. Copy it to any folder and it will still work
4. Share with others - no Python installation required

## Technical Notes
