## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in details**:
   - Repository name: `chucksteroids` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `Chucksteroids v5 - Cross-platform space shooter game`
   - Make it **Public** (for free GitHub Actions)
   - **Don't** initialize with README (we already have files)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

**Copy the commands from GitHub** (they'll look like this):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/chucksteroids.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Run these in your terminal** (I'll help you with this)

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click "Actions" tab**
3. **Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
4. **You should see 3 workflows**:
   - Build Windows Version
   - Build macOS Version  
   - Build and Release All Platforms

### Step 4: Trigger Your First Build

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
- Just push any change to trigger builds
- Go to Actions tab to watch them run

**Option B: Manual**
- Go to Actions tab
- Click on any workflow
- Click "Run workflow" button

### Step 5: Download Your Builds

1. **Go to Actions tab**
2. **Click on a completed workflow run**
3. **Scroll down to "Artifacts"**
4. **Download**:
   - `ChuckSTARoids-Windows` (Windows .exe)
   - `ChuckSTARoids-macOS` (macOS .app)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Commands Don't Work
1. **Check your GitHub username** in the URL
2. **Make sure repository name** matches exactly
3. **Try HTTPS instead of SSH** if prompted

### If Builds Fail
1. **Check Actions tab** for error logs
2. **Verify all game assets** are in the repository
3. **Make sure main files** are present:
   - `chuckstaroidsv5.py`
   - `music.py`
   - `xwing.ico`
   - All `.gif` files

### If Downloads Don't Work
1. **Wait for builds** to complete (5-10 minutes)
2. **Check artifact expiration** (30 days)
3. **Try different browser** if needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Proceed?

I can help you with any of these steps:

1. **Run the GitHub commands** for you
2. **Check if everything is ready** for pushing
3. **Walk through GitHub setup** step by step
